Description: LearnBayes contains a collection of functions helpful in learning
    the basic tenets of Bayesian statistical inference. It contains functions
    for summarizing basic one and two parameter posterior distributions and
    predictive distributions. It contains MCMC algorithms for summarizing posterior
    distributions defined by the user. It also contains functions for regression
    models, hierarchical models, Bayesian tests, and illustrations of Gibbs
    sampling.
